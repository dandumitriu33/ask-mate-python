    <h1>Information</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to the Ask Mate questions and answers board.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an educational product for
        <a href="https://codecool.com/en/">Codecool</a>  students and the
        information on this page is fictional. Any resemblance to user data
        or PII is purely fictional and for testing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of the exercise is to simulate a Stack Overflow or Quora
        board with questions, answers, comments and different features one
        might find on these websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Night mode</h2>

    <p>
        One of the main considerations for the UI choices is the dark colors
        and white text. This is easier on the eyes. As at this point no JavaScript
        is used, a toggle is not in place and only night mode is available.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, "day mode", which resembles the "pen on paper/typewriter" medium
        was most likely introduced to make users feel more familiar with the
        new environment (when computers were introduced).
    </p>
    <p>
        Heavy computer users prefer a dark background with light color text
        because of the strain on the eyes is lower during long sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course this information is fictional and not backed up by any scientific
        research but I can't wait for Spreadsheets to get night-mode.
    </p>

    <h2>Mobile first</h2>

    <p>
        This is a new principle in web design where websites are designed with
        mobile devices in mind first and then desktops as mobile use around
        the world has gone up significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an article from Google about mobile-first indexing:
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-first-indexing"> Google Developers</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Try it on your phone or if you're on a desktop:<br>
        <strong>FireFox</strong>: Menu &gt; Web Developer &gt; Responsive Design Mode<br>
        <strong>Chrome</strong>: Menu &gt; More tools &gt; Developer tools &gt; top right corner of the tools has a
        "Toggle device toolbar" button that looks like a phone (or press Ctrl + Shift + M).
    </p>
    <h2>
        Thanks
    </h2>
    <p>
        Thanks for taking a look. More features will be added as the project progresses.
    </p>
